Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. 

This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

Refer to [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) for detailed configuration.
